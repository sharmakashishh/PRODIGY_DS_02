## 📉 Key Objectives

- Handle and clean missing data
- Encode categorical variables
- Visualize survival rates by various features
- Understand feature correlation

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Dropped irrelevant columns: `Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`, `PassengerId`
- Filled missing `Age` values with median
- Filled missing `Embarked` with mode
- Encoded `Sex` and `Embarked` into numerical values

## 🔍 Insights

- **Females had a significantly higher survival rate** than males.
- **Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive**.
- **Younger passengers had slightly higher chances of survival**.
- **Embarked location and fare also influenced survival**.
